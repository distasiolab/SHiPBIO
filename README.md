Code and Workbooks are in `src` directory.

Current workflow is:

1) Move individual sample *.h5ad files containing cropped & annotated (e.g. 'Retina' ROIs) data into a known location
2) `python Preprocess.py` (basically just loads and concatenates all datasets, saves resulting object in `calc` directory)
3) `python IntegrateHarmony.py` (batch correction)
4) `python GeneratePlots.py`
